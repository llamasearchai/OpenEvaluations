```python
from openevals.core.adapters import AbstractAdapter

class CustomAdapter(AbstractAdapter):
    def configure(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        # Initialize your custom AI system
        pass
    
    async def generate_response(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Implement response generation
        pass

# Register your adapter
register_adapter("custom_model", CustomAdapter)
```

### Evaluation Metrics

Extensible grading system with built-in and custom metrics:

```python
from openevals.core.graders import MetricFunction, register_grader

@register_grader("custom_metric")
def custom_metric(response: str, expected: str, **kwargs) -> float:
    # Implement your custom evaluation logic
    score = calculate_custom_score(response, expected)
    return score

## Security

OpenEvals is built with security best practices:
- **Credential Management**: API keys and secrets are never hardcoded; use environment variables and secure config files.
- **Input Sanitization**: All user and model inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular scans for vulnerabilities using tools like `bandit` and `pip-audit`.
- **Sandboxing**: Model execution and evaluation are isolated to prevent code injection and data leaks.
- **Access Control**: API endpoints can be protected with authentication and authorization middleware.

---

## Professional Standards

OpenEvals is engineered for reliability and maintainability:
- **Type Safety**: All core modules use type annotations and are checked with `mypy`.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated tests and linting on every commit.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every public class and function is documented.
- **Extensive Test Coverage**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests ensure correctness.
- **Code Review**: All contributions are peer-reviewed for quality and security.
